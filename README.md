## About

Anytime I've learned a new language, I've put off proper package structure, telling myself I'll figure out how to organize my code later. I've tried to take a different approach with node. This boilerplate is an attempt to set forth a structure that makes sense to me and that I like to use. It is in no way the "right" way to do things, and elements may in fact be the wrong way to go, so any advice is welcome! I'm planning to evolve this repo anytime I learn new techniques for building projects that utilize Node.js.

## Features I Like

1. Using prettier and eslint together to keep my code clean and reduce inconsistencies
2. Adding an npm script as a precommit hook to keep me from committing ugly code to github
3. Using nodemon anytime I'm testing new things

## The Next Topics I Want to Explore

1. Testing and error handling frameworks
2. Gulp vs npm scripts for builds
